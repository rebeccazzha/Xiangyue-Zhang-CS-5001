    The main learning point from this project is that database can significantly increase the efficiency of creating a website, However, it is still important t\p consider the advantages vs. disadvantages when attaching local and online links into the database. 
    What I liked about my program is that first it has real functionality, and people can actually utilize it in their everyday lives; and secondly, it has functionalities that no other websites has done before: filter the selection by base alcohols. I think it will really benefit people when searching cocktail recipes at home. 
    However, there are also things that I found struggling. For example, I had trouble figuring out how to use html syntax appropriately, and I did not know how to implement for loops into html syntax. However, after researching and learning from different platforms, I figured out how to implement for loops in html so I do not need to manually input the information one by one. 
    About this project, I feel like I could improve the search box in the future. Since the primary purpose of this website is being convenient, I hope I can implement functions like searching by name or ingredients. 
    In the future, I wish I could develop this program into a website that supports searching by name or ingredients, and also supports filtering by alcohol% or time needed to make.
